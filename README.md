# ZeroDivisionError in Python
This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Python: ZeroDivisionError. The error occurs when attempting to divide a number by zero. 

## Bug Description
The `function` attempts to divide `a` by `b`. If `b` is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised.

## Solution
The solution involves adding a check to prevent division by zero.  This can be done using a conditional statement to ensure the denominator is not zero before performing the division, or using exception handling with a `try-except` block to handle potential errors gracefully.
